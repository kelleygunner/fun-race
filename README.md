-This iteration took about 4,5 hours

-There weren't any too difficult parts. The most thing I stuck on is Game Loop, dinamic level creation and other code-related stuff.

- (The part to do better) Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to implement all my visual ideas and level design. I would like to improve alse some things like camera smoothness, physics, and mise-en-scene stuff and add more effects like splashes, dust or something else. I would like to do this game with rough graphics, minimalistic level, simple shapes and cube particles. I think Low-Poly style fits perfect for this game.

- (Step further) - Rivals and Level design. I would like to make more complicated levels with spikes. For example "two easy obsticle - one hard obsticle" Loop would be perfect to keep player in tension, but not to press him too much.
One more important thing I would work on is different rewardeds, player skins and achievments. It could be monetized with ads.
I don't think players would spend money without any Meta-things, but it is ok to watch a couple of Rewarded videos to get any Special Skin (Like sexy girl or tough beast).
